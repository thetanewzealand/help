### Images

Images belong in the 'img' folder and can be uploaded as follows.

- Make sure you're in the thetanewzealand/thetanewzealand folder.

- Click on the 'img' folder.

![img folder](img/img_folder.png)

Click the 'upload files' button on the right of the page.

![img folder](img/upload.png)

Drag your files across or click **choose your files**

![img folder](img/choose.png)

Find the image you'd like to use then click open.

To display the image on a page you will need to use the following text.

    ![Image Title](img/imagename.extension)

    ![Image Title] - This is the name of the image
    (img/imagename.extension) - This is where the image is stored

For example, if we wanted to upload the Theta logo and the file name was 'logo.png' we would write the following text:

    ![Theta Logo](img/logo.png)

The image title would be Theta Logo
And the image path would be **img/logo.png**

This will produce:

![Theta Logo](logo.png)
